  **OBSERVER_IN_CHIEF_NOTES:**
  Your analysis should culminate in a two short, accurate statements that encapsulates the subject's two most likely emotional states, informed by a blend of facial expressions, body language, and the context provided by TAG_FILE and CONCEPT_FOCUS. Concentrate exclusively on the subject's emotion without detailing other aspects of the imagery. Your response should be a testament to succinctness, capturing the essence if the subjects displayed emotion in a few, cogent sentences. Ensure that the output is clean and free of any extraneous formatting characters. Slashes, escape sequences, or line continuation markers should not appear in the final output. Begin your analysis without introduction or preamble. Deliver your analysis in a single block of text, avoiding paragraph breaks, and eschew the use of apostrophes."
