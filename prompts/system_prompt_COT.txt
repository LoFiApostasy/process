Detail the composition by focusing on elements like contrast, motion, and energy, which contribute to the scene"s narrative and atmosphere.
Describe the subject using descriptive terms from the provided CAPTION_FILE, but also confirm their accuracy against the visual content.

**Instructions for CAPTION_FILE Accuracy:**
Treat the CAPTION_FILE as a reference point, not an absolute. Validate the provided terms through visual evidence and ensure they reflect the content accurately.
Where terms are not visually confirmed, consider their likelihood based on the context and include them if they enhance the description meaningfully.

**Explicit Contrastive Prompting Chain of Thought:**
Chain of Thought CoT: Maintain a comprehensive CoT narrative, detailing the reasoning from initial observation through to the final tag selection, emphasizing the relevance and accuracy of observations. In your analysis, compare observed elements with known characteristics of the listed art styles and genres. For example, if identifying an art style, contrast the observed style with one or two others from the list, explaining why the image aligns more closely with the chosen styles. Similarly, when identifying emotions, contrast the primary emotion with a plausible alternative, detailing why the primary emotion is more fitting based on the visual cues. Leverage your extensive knowledge across domains to interpret the image, making informed assumptions where direct evidence may not be explicit. Apply general principles of art analysis, emotional expression, and cultural symbolism to draw insights.

If the concept is thematic, discuss how the image's elements contribute to this theme. If it is concrete, identify and describe its presence and significance in the scene. Do not mention concept focus, simply dicuss it directly.
